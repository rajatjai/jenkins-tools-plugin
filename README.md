Jenkins Trend Report Plugin
===========================

This [Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/) plug-in generates the trend report for any static analyzer or model checker tools.
It expects a json file which contains all the results of the tools.

This tool is built similar to <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cppcheck+Plugin>
