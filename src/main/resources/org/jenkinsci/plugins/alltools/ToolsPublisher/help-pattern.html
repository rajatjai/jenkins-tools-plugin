<p style="margin-top: 0px;">The tools whose analysis is needed must be executed to generate json reports for this plugin to function.
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Fileset
'includes'</a> setting specifies the generated Tools json report files,
such as '**/cbmc-*ToolsErrors.json'. Base directory of the fileset is relative
to the workspace root directory.</p>

<p>If no value is set, then the default '**/ToolsErrors3.json' will be used.
Be sure to never include any non-report files into this pattern.</p>

<p>The plugin is able to work with json files produced by any static analyzer or model checker tools.</p>
